Introduction
This repository showcases various design patterns and data structures in C#, along with analyses of time complexity (Big_O.cs). By exploring these implementations, you can gain a deeper understanding of how to write cleaner, more efficient, and more maintainable code.

Console_Test: Contains sample test code to demonstrate how the implemented data structures and patterns can be run and tested.
DataStructure: Houses all the C# files that implement and explain common data structures (e.g., arrays, stacks). Big_O.cs provides time complexity analysis.
DesignPattern: Contains folders for each design pattern category, with corresponding C# implementations.
Design Patterns
This repository includes examples of well-known design patterns in C#, such as:

Bridge: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation.
Composite: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
Decorator: Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects.
Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
Flyweight: Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
Each pattern directory typically includes:

Core Interfaces/Abstract Classes
Concrete Implementations
Usage Examples (where applicable)
Data Structures
The data structures portion includes:

Arrays: Basic array manipulation and traversal.
Stacks: LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure with push/pop operations.
Big O Analysis: A file dedicated to explaining the complexity of common operations.
Additional data structures may be included or added over time, each with comments explaining functionality and time complexity.

Getting Started
Clone the Repository
bash

If necessary, restore any NuGet packages for dependencies.
Usage
Explore: Browse through the DataStructure and DesignPattern folders to understand various implementations.
Run Examples: Navigate to the Console_Test project and run it. You can add or modify test cases here to experiment with the data structures and patterns.
Study: Each file is documented with comments to help you understand the purpose, functionality, and complexity of the implementation.
